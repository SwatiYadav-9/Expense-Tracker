# Expense-Tracker

The Expense Tracker Web Application is a personal finance management tool designed to help individuals track, organize, and evaluate their monthly spending. Users can enter their monthly salary and add detailed expenses by amount, category (like Food, Rent, Electricity, etc.), and description. The application dynamically displays these entries in a sortable table and offers the ability to filter expenses by category. It also includes features to delete individual expense records, making it easy to correct or manage financial data. One of the appâ€™s key strengths lies in its ability to visualize expense patterns through a responsive pie chart powered by Chart.js, giving users an intuitive overview of where their money is being spent.

Beyond basic tracking, the app introduces intelligent budget analysis and recommendation features. After the user sets a monthly salary, the application calculates whether expenses in specific categories exceed predefined budget thresholds based on financial best practices (e.g., food shouldn't exceed 15% of salary). It provides meaningful suggestions to encourage better savings habits, like advising the user if their remaining balance is too low. These real-time insights promote financial awareness and help users make smarter decisions about where and how to cut down on spending.

Technically, the app is built using a robust combination of technologies: HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript form the frontend, while Python (Flask) manages the backend and serves dynamic routes. The SQLite database is used for persistent data storage, offering a lightweight and efficient solution without requiring complex setup. The app is designed to be fully functional locally without login or internet dependency, making it ideal for students, freelancers, and working professionals who need a fast, private, and easy-to-use expense tracking tool. Its responsive UI, minimalistic design, and thoughtful features make it a valuable entry-level financial planning solution for personal use.
